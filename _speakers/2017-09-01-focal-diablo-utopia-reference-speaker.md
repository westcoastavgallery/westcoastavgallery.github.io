Compact, distinguished, captivating, audiophile, Diablo Utopia is the ultimate vision of the reference bookshelf loudspeaker, in the purest Focal's tradition. Largely inspired from the Grande Utopia EM, it sets new milestones in the bass thanks to its new patented 6-1/2" (16.5cm) Power Flower, with almost no saturation, and a driver integrated resonator. Fixed on a dedicated stand, Diablo Utopia enchants the midrange and the treble with its definition, demonizes the bass with a density and a power handling never reached so far.
