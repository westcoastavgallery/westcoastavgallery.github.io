summary: 'Many factors go into creating the perfect home theatre system, but not one is more important than the audio. You cannot create that immersive cinematic experience in your home without considering your audio system. Think about it: Jaws would not be Jaws unless you felt your heart rate rise with each “duun-dun,” and Star Wars would not be Star Wars without the classic lightsaber sound effects. The powerful audio system is a huge reason we want to go out to the movies. So, when you’re trying to bring the theatre experience home, you must recreate that system. Luckily, the Persona series from Paradigm has arrived to elevate your home theatre. Read on to learn more.'

    <p>Many factors go into creating the perfect <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/services/residential#home-theater">home theatre system</a>, but not one is more important than the audio. You cannot create that immersive cinematic experience in your home without considering your audio system. Think about it: Jaws would not be Jaws unless you felt your heart rate rise with each “duun-dun,” and Star Wars would not be Star Wars without the classic lightsaber sound effects. The powerful audio system is a huge reason we want to go out to the movies. So, when you’re trying to bring the theatre experience home, you must recreate that system. Luckily, the Persona series from Paradigm has arrived to elevate your home theatre. Read on to learn more.</p>
    <h2>The Persona Promise</h2>
    <p>The Persona is the latest series from Paradigm, crafters of high performance audio equipment. Every speaker or subwoofer they sell comes with a promise: it has been handcrafted in Canada and represents a culmination of audio technology. During the designing process, the engineers sought to use all their combined knowledge and Paradigm’s history to develop novels ways of producing the best sound. A key component was the use of beryllium in the midrange. Beryllium is a rare and rigid material that creates a cleaner sound than most materials typically used. When you’re hearing your film through a Persona speaker, you can trust you’re hearing the clearest version. </p>
    <p>By building their own cabinets, Paradigm has designed a speaker meant to fit your lifestyle. For one they used an elliptical design to create a big speaker that doesn’t overwhelm a room. Also, the Persona comes in various colors to match your home theatre. By having their own speaker cabinet manufacturing space, they can pay attention to every aspect of creation.</p>

    <h2>Great Sound in Any Space</h2>
    <p>One of the most difficult aspects of adding <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/services/residential#audio-distribution">audio</a> to a home theatre system is matching the speakers to the acoustics of the room. The Persona 9H features Anthem room correction technology built-in. This allows the Persona to adjust its own levels depending on the acoustics of the theatre. You can trust that the bass will be performing as it should and that the sound quality is natural. The Persona makes the installation process quicker and easier.
  </p>
  <h2>Sound Dispersion </h2>
  <p>You want your home theatre to have full sound to create the full experience. The Paradigm team realized that the grill has a lot to do with the way the sound disperses. They spent a lot of time creating their grill, not only for looks but to improve performance. The grills perform something called perforated phase alignment, which means that they help cancel out out-of-phase sounds that are radiated by the cone. This means that the sound is smoother and this widens out the dispersion of the sound. The Persona will fill the whole theatre with the best sound quality, so everyone in the room will have a cinematic experience. </p>
