		<p>Looking for that low note that really moves you. Come by our showroom for an audition. Find the right sub for your sound system or home theatre. Featuring subwoofers by Martin Logan and Paradigm Speakers.</p>
		<p>A subwoofer is made up of one or more large drivers in a single cabinet. It is specifically designed to reproduce the low-pitched audio frequencies known as "bass" and covers the range between 20 Hz and 200 Hz. A subwoofer enhances the frequency range of a speaker system by delivering the lowest bass notes, a frequency area that a typical speaker cannot fully deliver, and gives dynamic impact to the low-frequency effects in movies and music.</p>
