		<p>Here are a couple of fantastic Anthem MXR 1120 reviews.</p>
    <p>“Simply put, the MRX 1120 is kind of in a class of its own right now. At the very least, I'm drawing a complete blank when trying to think of any other 11.2-channel receivers that feature this level of multichannel and stereo sonic performance combined with this much customizability.”</p>

    <p>“AVR sounds beautifully precise and balanced. Soundtracks are tight and involving: bass is deep and granite hard, while dialogue remains crisp and articulate.”</p>
