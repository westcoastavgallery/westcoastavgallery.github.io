    <h3>4 Essentials for Your Home Theatre System</h3>
    <img alt="" width="630" height="420" src="/images/articles/17-04-theatre.png" />
    <p>If you love the theatre experience, it might be time to bring it home. With the help of home automation and top-notch audio video equipment, you can create the look and feel of a professional movie theatre in your basement or den. Designing your West Vancouver, BC  home <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/services/residential">theatre system</a> can feel a little daunting, especially as there are multiple pieces of the puzzle that have to fit together. Bringing in an audio video professional can take the guess work out of the installation process. In the meantime, we’ve compiled a list of a few items you’ll need to get started. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>The audio can make or break the movie watching experience. Cinema quality sound can create an immersive experience for the whole audience. There are a few steps that you’ll need to create the ideal surround sound experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acoustics: Whatever room you’ve selected as your dedicated home theatre, it probably is not yet engineered with the perfect acoustics. The proper acoustics ensure that sound will not escape into other rooms and optimize the quality of your audio.</li>
      <li>Equipment: The best equipment depends on many factors like the layout of the room and acoustics. It’s best to work with an audio professional to find the right components and put the pieces together.</li>
      <li>Speaker Placement: Even if you have the top-of-the-line speakers, if they aren’t in the right spot, your sound will still be muffled or imperfect. Work with your audio professional to perfectly place the speakers throughout the room so that every member of the audience will feel like they’re a part of the film.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Video</h2>
    <p>When you first think of a home theater, you probably think of a projector and a large screen. You’ll want to ensure that the projector and screen are precisely paired so that the projected image fits the shape and size of the screen. One brand of projectors we like is <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/brands">Wolf Cinema</a>. They offer high-quality and long lasting equipment. The type of screen that you select depends on the space and your needs. You can choose between models that come down from the ceiling or remain stationary on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>Some homeowners prefer to use a television as their screen. You can achieve some truly spectacular picture quality with the latest 4K or OLED models. However, you will not be able to achieve as large a picture as is possible with a projector and screen.
    </p>
    <h2>Lighting</h2>
    <p>Whatever video option you select, the rooms natural and artificial lighting can drastically change the picture quality. For starters, if your theater is in a room with many windows, you’ll need a way to block out that light. Blackout motorized shades are the best way to give you control over the illumination.
    </p>
    <p>Next, incorporate <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/services/residential">lighting control</a> to create the right artificial lighting settings. Create different lighting “scenes” for different needs. When you hit play, have all the lights automatically fade to black, except some track lighting along paths and perhaps some low level sconces to see your snack bar. When it’s time to pause the movie for a bathroom break, the lights rise marginally along the pathway, but remain dim enough not to disturb an audience adjusted to lights out.
    </p>
    <h2>Integration</h2>
    <p>With all of these elements, you’ll need a simple way to control your home theatre. That’s where home automation comes into play. All of your technologies will be under one system, and then you can use a tablet in the seat or even your smartphone to start the movie, dim the lights, close the shades or make whatever changes you desire</p>
