		<p>There’s nothing more important than keeping your family and home safe.  Now whether you’re home or away, you can rest assured that both will be.  By installing <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/blog/category/home-security-system/">a smart home security system</a>, you can guarantee your White Rock, BC home will be protected and safeguarded against any intruders or trespassers.  The integrated system enables you to keep a defended home, with multiple features that provide efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
		<h2>Instantly Notified</h2>
		<p>Now when an alarm or sensor goes off, get immediately notified on your phone or smart device while you’re out at dinner or on vacation.  Push notifications will show if someone is at your door, and you can assess the situation straight away.  Monitor if it is your kids arriving home from school, an unwanted guest intruding, or even if the door is left open or unlocked.  With immediate notifications, you will always be on top of your surveillance.</p>
		<h2>No Key Required</h2>
		<p>No longer will you have to keep track of, maintain, and ultimately misplace, physical keys for your home.  With smart locks, you won’t have to endlessly dig through your bags or purse to enter your own house. A smart access system means scanning a single fingerprint, punching in an access code, or even just using your smart phone to unlock your front door with ease.  Never worry again if you’ll be locked out or stuck scavenging for your spare key to make it inside in time for your favorite show’s premiere.</p>
		<h2>Automatic Monitor and Response</h2>
		<p>With remote access, you can instantly check surveillance and unlock doors when needed – but what about the time in between when an incident occurs, the system notifies you, and when you can decide your next steps?  A genuinely smart security system takes action for you.  Active monitoring manages every area of the house, and will automatically counter dangers.  If an intruder or threat is spotted, every door can be locked and secured, with the police dialed and on the way.  Take the concern out of leaving your house, and let your home system respond to any happenings that might come its way.</p>
		<p>A security system can make all the difference for a secure peace of mind. To learn further about the features above and more, contact us at (604) 669-5001 or <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/contact">online through our contact page.</a>
