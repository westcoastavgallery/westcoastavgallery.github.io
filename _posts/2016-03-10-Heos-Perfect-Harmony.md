				There are times when you fire up the grill with your buddies, overtly decide that meat is the only real food group, and use utensils to an increasingly optional degree…but that’s for a different day; a day with the boys. Tonight (or maybe this weekend, if you’re planning ahead), you need to impress a special someone, and that kind of meal will not suffice. Whether you’re romancing your significant other, or assuring your mom that you learned some useful household skills after all, put on a clean shirt, apron up, and pair these elegant themed dinners with the right playlist for a night that’s sure to amaze.</p>
				
				<h2>
				Italian Inspired Dinner</h2>
				<p>
				Few things are more romantic than bringing the flavors and spirit of Italy right to your kitchen counter (unless of course you’re in Italy, in which case, nevermind). You can add to the effect with mood-setting candles and a good pour of Barolo wine, several years aged. While you put the finishing touches on your meal, lay out a loaf of rosemary bread with some oil and vinegar to get your special guest ready to dine. </p>
				<p>

						<strong>
						Main Dish: Bolognese</strong>
					</span>
					<br>
				Originating from Bologna, Italy, this aptly named dish is revamped with a fresher, lighter style. Chock-full of vibrant flavors, an aroma of spices, and more vegetable colors than you ever knew existed, this modernized entree will get the good-mood vibes flowing.</p>

						<strong>
						Beverage: Americano Cocktail</strong>
					</span>
					<br>
					In addition to your stunning main dish, you can really mix in la dolce vita with a classic Italian cocktail. Check out some <a href="http://www.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive_300/362_classic-italian-cocktails.html" target="_blank">

						<strong>
						Main Dish: Seafood Paella</strong>
					</span>
					<br>
				There are a lot of different takes on paella, but one of this dish’s shining attributes is its versatility: If your guest isn’t a seafood lover, you can always substitute for chicken or chorizo, or anything else for that matter, just shy of packaged hot dogs (and even then…). You might have to travel into uncharted territory at the grocery store for some of the ingredients, but on the plus side, this dish is relatively easy to make!</p>

				<h2>
				French Dinner Fare</h2>
				<p>
					This meal is the perfect luxury, giving in to mouth-watering tastes and satiating that sweet tooth. Set the stage with a starter beverage of champagne or
					<a href="http://heosvibe.denon.com/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?Id=29" target="_blank">
					fancy coc​ktail</a>
				(we recommend the French 75) to prep the palatte for culinary wonderment, and you can always impress with some fresh flowers on the table (it shows you were thinking ahead—just make sure to take off the cellophane wrapper, because that’s where the price tag is).&nbsp; </p>

						<strong>
						Main Dish: Filet Mignon with Truffle Mushroom Ragout</strong>
					</span>

Your dinner date might appreciate the timelessness of a good filet mignon, but will be wowed by your next-level ingenuity (yes, take the credit for this invention, we’ll never tell).<br>
