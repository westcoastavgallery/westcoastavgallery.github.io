<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like the feeling of moving into a new house. The whole space buzzes with possibilities and improvements. In this day and age, technology allows us the opportunity to, not only customize our living spaces, but optimize them. <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/services/residential#homecontrol">Home automation</a> gives new homeowners the power to access their electronic devices and systems from any location in the world, and even let their home run on autopilot. Control4 is the brain behind your West Vancouver, BC smart home, connecting and controlling all of your home&rsquo;s devices into one easy-to-manage system. Interested in enhancing your new living space? Read on for some tips to keep in mind throughout your new construction or interior design process.&nbsp;</p><h4><br />Make a Plan</h4><p>Whether your new home is being built from the ground up or you are just adding some improvements, moving into a new space provides the perfect opportunity to seamlessly <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/demos/virtual-demo">integrate</a> smart automation into your life. The best way to ensure your smart home works perfectly is to bring in a local professional. During the construction phase, our team will work with you and your builder to design an automation system that works efficiently and is completely hidden in your space. By installing the right wires and components during the construction phase, you&rsquo;ll get a stronger system that works seamlessly, instead of a wireless one that is worked in as an afterthought. During the design phase, a professional can help you select the devices that will work best in your home and fit your lifestyle instead of giving you a catch-all solution. With the proper planning and a professional&rsquo;s eye, you can anticipate and prevent any potential issues.</p><p><strong>See Also:<a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/demos/smart-home-layout"> Smart Home Layout</a></strong></p><h4>Setting the Scene&nbsp;</h4><p>Once the Control4 system is in place, there are countless ways to enhance usability. One method is to program &ldquo;scenes.&rdquo; As you go through life, your devices perform similar patterns when you&rsquo;re performing certain tasks. For instance, when you&rsquo;re cooking dinner, maybe you like to turn all the lights on in the kitchen, listen to Motown tunes, and watch your favourite cooking show on mute. Set that as your &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; scene, and press one button to create your culinary environment. Control4 can cultivate any number of these &ldquo;scenes&rdquo; at the touch of a button, by integrating all of your devices, and letting you control them all in one place.</p><h4><br />Upgrades and Enhancements</h4><p>Something else to keep in mind about your Control4 home is that you can continue adding more and more devices as they come onto the marketplace. Just last month, Control4 announced that Alexa products from Amazon could integrate with their platform. The result is an automated home that needs no remote, just your voice. The rapidly expanding world of smart technology can be readily accessible to you and your family, making your everyday experiences more and more remarkable. As you open the door to your new home, you could be stepping into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about what Control4 can offer your new space, <a href="https://westcoastavgallery.ca/contact">contact us</a> and we can begin planning today.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div><div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div></div>
