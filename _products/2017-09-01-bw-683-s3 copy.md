The 683 S2 features a Decoupled Double Dome tweeter - technology evolved from Bowers & Wilkins CM10 speaker. The double dome design uses an extremely thin aluminium dome for lightness, surrounded by a thicker aluminium ring for rigidity. The result is a far more precise treble performance. And while the tweeter looks like it’s part of the main speaker, it’s physically separated in its own gel-filled cavity, so performance isn’t hit by unwanted resonances or vibrations, for a more natural, spacious sound.

Serious and accurate bass performance is equally vital to such a room-filling speaker. That’s why the 683 S2 features a new bass driver construction method, using a similar method of bracing to the tweeter with twin layers of aluminium. The richer, distortion-free bass response is sumptuous.

As well as new bass driver construction techniques and a new tweeter, brought in from Bower & Wilkins high-end series, the 683 S2 also boasts an FST Kevlar midrange driver. Serious technology, serious performance, but seriously affordable for a speaker of this calibre.
