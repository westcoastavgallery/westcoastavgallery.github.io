		<p>"Westcoast AV Gallery has exceeded all of the expectations I had for my Media Room, audio distribution and automation requirements. They have provided a spectacular theatre experience in my home that is very functional as well as easy to operate. The work that Westcoast AV Gallery performed is aesthetically clean while providing extreme performance and ease of use.  I would highly recommend Westcoast AV Galleys’ service anyone looking for an audio/video/integration system that will perform to a very high level and be very easy to use."</p>
